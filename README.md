# 📘 Food Truck Tracker

*A live, location based platform for both food truck owners and customers to find each other.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

I’m developing a Des Moines focused food truck discovery app where owners can broadcast their locations and keep profiles current through a streamlined update form. The app centralizes truck schedules and events so local foodies never miss new vendors or surprise pop ups.

## ✨ Features

* Create, read, update, and delete truck listings
* Responsive UI with reusable components
* Backend API with full CRUD operations
* Data persisted in MongoDB
* Advanced feature: External API integration [tomtom API](https://www.tomtom.com/company/)
* Error handling on client + server

### **Advanced Feature**

This app uses tomtom's Map and Geocoding APIs. The map is loaded through the tomtom SDK using my personal API key to call their hosted services. The Geocoding API is fetched with an HTTPS request and API key to exchange the truck owners address for a longitude and lattitude that can be displayed on the customer map.

## 📸 Screenshots

> Include 2–4 screenshots of your app.
> Use relative paths (e.g., `/screenshots/home.png`) or full URLs.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Describe how the pieces fit together.

```
/frontend
  /src
    /components
    /pages
    App.jsx
    main.jsx

/backend
  /models
  /routes
  server.js
```

Include a sentence explaining the flow:

> The React frontend communicates with the Express backend through API routes. The backend interacts with MongoDB using Mongoose models, and environment variables are used to store secrets.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### **1. Clone the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

---

### **2. Environment Variables**

Include a `.env.example` file in both repos.

**Backend `.env.example`:**

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_url
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_if_using_auth
API_KEY=if_using_external_apis
```

**Frontend `.env.example`:**

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**

#### Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### **4. Running Entire App Locally**

1. Start backend on `http://localhost:4000`
2. Start frontend on `http://localhost:5173`
3. Confirm CORS + API requests are working

---

## 🛠 API Documentation

Document the **main 3–5 routes**:

### **GET /api/resource**

Returns all resources.

### **POST /api/resource**

Creates a new resource.
Body example:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "description": "Text here"
}
```

### **PATCH /api/resource/:id**

Updates a resource.

### **DELETE /api/resource/:id**

Deletes a resource.

> Add additional routes if needed (auth, file uploads, WebSockets, etc.).

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

Document where/how you deployed:

### **Frontend**

* Vercel / Netlify
* Explain build command if different (`npm run build`)

### **Backend**

* Render / Railway
* Note environment variable setup
